                    <b>Margaret Heafield Hamilton</b> (born August 17, 1936) is an American <i><b>computer scientist</b>, systems engineer and business owner.</i> She was director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo space program. She later founded two software companiesâ€”Higher Order Software in 1976 and Hamilton Technologies in 1986, both in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<br>
                    Hamilton has published more than 130 papers, proceedings and reports about sixty projects and six major programs. She is one of the people credited with coining the term "software engineering".<br>
                    On November 22, 2016, Hamilton received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama for her work leading to the development of on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo Moon missions.
