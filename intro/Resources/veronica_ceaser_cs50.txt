Here are the things I think you should think upon(line by line of your program)

1. Add ctype.h and stdlib.h
2. instead of argc == 2 try argc != 2 and print the error immediately
3. userargument is not a good variable name try user_argument or something short.
4. I think better name for user_arg_ascii could be 'key' (but doesn't matter) 
5. you don't need plaintext_ascii(Why? We will see later)[Save Resources].
6. Similarly you don't need ciphertext
7. Here check that userargument is all digit or not with a for loop and isdigit() function.
8. instead of for loop try atoi function.
9. Now you dont need the next if argument( if (user_arg_ascii > 47 && user_arg_ascii < 58) )
beacause you have already check that in step 7.
10. declare plaintext.
11.now decide how much you need to shift each character?
	lets take examples
	if the text is "abc" and key(user_arg_ascii) is 3
	then shift for first letter is 'a' + key
	generalizing shift = plaintext[i] +  key
    but what if their is a 'z'
	then 'z' + key will be some different character than 'a'
	for that we wrap up with
	int shift = ('a' - 1) + (shift % 90) [Try doing this on paper to get the idea]
	
	generalizing plaintext[i] = shift;

Decide where you need to use loops and conditions.
now you have a scrambled plaintext which is indeed the ciphertext.
print "ciphertext: "
print the plaintext array without '\n'

I tried my best to help you without showing the correct answer.
(some changes are just for design purposes, you can have a correct program without them)

If I confused you more then forget all that and
Try solving the problem on paper first and then try to program it.
Sorry!!!
